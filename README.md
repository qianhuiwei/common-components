# common components

(This app is still under development...)

This is a simple React app that demonstrates some common React components:<br />
* Button
* Accordion
* Dropdown
* Modal
* Sidebar, Route & Links
* Table 
<img src="" width=""/>

## Features
* Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
* Imported icons using [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
* Applied [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) to conditionally join class names.
* Implemented application navigation and page routing.
* Used React hooks to perform tasks in different life cycle stage (useEffect) and share global data between components (useContext).
* Tested with Chrome.
